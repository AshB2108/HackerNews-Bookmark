Threads,

The One Commandment of multithreaded programming,
1. Thou Shalt Not touch shared data without synchronization.
  You must know what data is shared, and you must synchronize all access to shared data
(with one exception, when all access is read-only).

2. Thou Shalt minimize and reduce shared mutable data as much as possible, in the 
design stage.Sometimes just making new copy and passing that around might not cause that much of 
a performance penalty vs the time spent debugging synchronization problems.
