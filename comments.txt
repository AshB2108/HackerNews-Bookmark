I agree with you on much of what you said and thanks for not attacking those that called you an idiot, they are the people I would like to punch in the face. Anyone who so quickly jumps to call someone an idiot for simply stating a point that many others have dealt with is just an asshole that needs a good beating. The internet is full of disrespectful pricks. Those people are the epitome of what is wrong with society.

Self delusion is pretty common in fanatical beliefs.

Outsourcing and globalization will be very profitable to companies. Prices will rise to the median global economy where business can produce a limited number of products and sale to only those who can afford their products. Placing their factories in impoverished areas and paying meager wages and cutting tax-break deals with the local community governments much the same as they are doing in China and Malaysia right now. They are making all things equal in respect that impoverished people will be on a global scale rather than a country by country valuation. 

We have discussed socializing the economy in various articles and this brings a question to mind. How do you force a company to pay scaled wages in a country when all it needs to do is move to a different country to avoid the higher production cost? 

Tax benefits are given as incentives to companies that produce on said country soil, which means taxes, will eventually be increased to accommodate the loss. Other words, you are still in the same boat only on a global scale and it will be far more difficult to control because of the enormity of the problems. This fantasy dream of Utopia is only that, a fantasy! Imperialist minded people have placed the definition of Imperialism on the word Capitalism, confusing those who do not know the difference, and monopolizing not a product, but production itâ€™s self.
