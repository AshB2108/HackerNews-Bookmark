Installing the media server and configuring,

XBMC:
- this is orginal media server with lot of hacks
- various installation available for windows, mac and jailbroken iDevice.
- I have installed it on Windows7,mac and iPhone.
- best way to configure the server is to install xbmc hub wizard. [hub wizard](http://www.xbmchub.com/blog/2013/05/26/how-to-instantly-configure-xbmc-with-the-xbmc-hub-wizard-beta-addon/)
- The hub wizard will configure most of the video addon required.
- The top hirearchy is Add-ons under setting.
- Each addon has a bunch of video addons, this should be installed and enabled.
- once this is done these video are available under videos.
- you can run xbmc on win or mac and remotely connect via remote app on iPhone, this can be mirrored on apple tv.



Plex:
- works as client/server model
- There is a bit o hack, apple tv DNS should be configured to the media server IP address.
- run the media sever on win or mac and use the iphone app to mirror on apple tv.
