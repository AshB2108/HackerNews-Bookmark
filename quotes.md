Back when I first got into the start-up scene, I used to work long hours because everyone else did. At some point, I realized that literally nothing has to be done RIGHT NOW OH MY GOD RIGHT NOW. Almost everything can wait until tomorrow morning. Sure, there are some high-priority bugs that are breaking the site that need to be fixed ASAP, but during normal operating procedures, once that clock hits 5pm, I should start wrapping up my work so that I can pick it up fresh in the morning.
I don't take my work home with me, I don't check my work email when I'm at home. It's just not worth the stress to me.
I love my job, I love my work, I feel like I'm contributing to making the world a better place -- it's just not 100% of who I am. I have a dog, a girlfriend, a handful of close friends, a few engaging hobbies, and a ton of books to read and miles to run. I'm more than my job, and once I can pay the bills, the rest of the money is just a nice to have -- but not nice enough to give up my health and sanity.
Then again, I'm extremely lucky to be in this situation, and a lot of people aren't. Some of my coworkers work long hours still, but they seem happy about it. As long as that's true,... well, whatever floats your boat, right?
